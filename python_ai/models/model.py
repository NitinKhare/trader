"""
Model module placeholder.

This module will contain ML model training and inference logic.
For v1, scoring is rule-based (see scoring/stock_scorer.py).
ML models will be added in future versions for improved scoring.

Design constraints:
  - No live inference during market hours.
  - No direct trade decisions.
  - No capital awareness.
  - All outputs are files (JSON/Parquet).
  - Fixed random seeds for reproducibility.
